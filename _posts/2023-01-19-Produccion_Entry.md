<p>Many people think that making video games is something that can be done on the fly, without any planning. But that's far away from reality. In fact, there are, most of the time, 7 different stages of game development.</p>
<p>Impending deadlines, bottlenecks in production, pressure from video game publishers, and endless work-weeks are just a few of the many challenges that arise during the development cycle.</p>
<p>With these 7 phases of game development, developers can meet these challenges and achieve video games that live up to expectations.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, these are the 7 stages of game development</p>

## Planning

<p>Before anything starts, the study has to think of an idea and develop it as much as possible, asking questions such as: What type of video game are we producing? Will it be 2D or 3D? What are some of the key features it must have? Who are its characters?</p>
<p>This step is crucial for the rest of the development, because a poorly defined game will never be entertaining for the players. Also, most studios opt at this stage of development to have a publisher. That's because it will also be necessary to estimate the resources that the study will require.</p>

## Pre-production

<p>At this stage, each department will conduct its own brainstorming session. The questions are now more specific, such as: Who are the main characters in this tale? What are their backstories?Can the scene have this elements? Can this machanics be in the final result?</p>
<p>Most of the times, as a result of this work, there is a prototype of the game</p>

## Production

<p>Most of the time, effort, and resources spent on developing video games are during the production stage. This also happens to be one of the most challenging stages of video game development.During this process all of the characters are designed and rendered, the audio design must be defined, the developers need to write thousands of lines of source code, and so on.</p>
<p>These events and many more could take years of iterating to get right, and that’s assuming only a few changes are made along the way, which is hardly the reality.</p>

## Testing

<p>Every game needs to pass this stage, if not, your game is not ready to be even an Alpha. There are different types of playtesters, some try to "break" the game and others try to check if they can have fun while playing the game.</p>
<p>At the end of this stage, the product will be ready to be lunch, but some studios prefer to pass the pre-launch stage.</p>

## Pre-launch

<p>Basically, this stage is about giving visibility to your game, most of the time through marketing campaigns.</p>

## Launch

<p>The months leading up to a game’s anticipated launch date is mostly spent squashing large backlogs of bugs – some old, some new found in the testing stage. For games with many bugs, a studio will create a hierarchy of bugs to squash. This hierarchy will include “game-crashing” bugs near the top and minor bugs near the bottom.</p>

## Post-production

<p>It’s not uncommon for video games to launch with batches of minor bugs. The first few months during the post-launch stage are typically spent identifying and squashing these bugs. Gaming studios also rely on players to submit bug reports or speak up about bugs in online forums. This is all part of post-launch support.</p>

<p>Another part of post-launch is to provide regular software updates for the game. These updates range from game-balancing patches to new downloadable content, or DLCs.</p>
