## About this project.
<p>This is a test to check the behavior of GOAP. There are 4 agents in total and every one of them have differents objectives and actions. The game is set in a medieval town which has been invaded by aliens. The villagers need to acquire materials such as minerals to craft weapons and food to survive. In the next section we are going to see the differents agents and his actions. All the assets of the scene are from the Asset Store.</p>

## The agents.

 * The hunter

<p>The hunter is the main actor of the scene. Without him, the village wouldn't have a chance to win against the aliens. They have three objetives in total, acquire resources, eat food and fight the aliens.</p>
<p>To acquire resources, the hunter first need to craft a weapon in the armory. Then he will go to the mountains, but if there are another three hunters there he will stay in the village. If he goes to the mountains, he will return to the town with the materials. Then, he needs to give all of it to a vendor to proceed, so he will wait to one of them.</p>
<p>But there is one inconvenience, if the hunter is at the town and is hungry, he can't go to the mountains. He isn't a machine! That's why he will go to the restaurant and stay some time in there while enjoying a plate of food</p>
<p>However, the peace doesn't last forever, the aliens could appear at any moment! The hunter will fight any alien that appears in town, and with his nordic powers... he will defeat them!</p>

 * The vendor
 
<p>The vendor has two objetives, sell food and clean the bodies of the defeated aliens</p>
<p>To sell the food, the vendor needs to get it from the hunter first. He will go to the store and talk to a hunter to get his resources. He will save them in his inventory and then go to the market and sell the food to a chef.</p>
<p>And why he needs to clean the bodies of the aliens? Because the fight takes place near the market, so if there are too many bodies in the floor, he couldn't meet the hunters and follow the process.</p>

 * The chef

<p>The chef has another two objectives, one of them is cooking the food and the other is rest</p>
<p>To start cooking, he first needs to go buy the food. To accomplish this, there needs to be a vendor who is selling in the market. If there is one, he will wait to the chef before doing anything else. Then, the vendor will get food in his inventory and go to the kitchen, where he will spend some time before serve the food.</p>
<p>But sometimes the chef can feel a little tired, so he will rest a little in some park that is nearby his kitchen.</p>

 * The alien

<p>The alien only wants one thing, and is to destroy the town. That's why he will first spy near the store when there are some hunters in there and then he will attack with some of his comrades.</p>

<p>This is how the finalt result looks!</p>
