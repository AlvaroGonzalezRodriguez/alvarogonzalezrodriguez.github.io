# The importance of level design
<p>Basically the game level design defines how a game can be played, if it is fun for the player and also if it is enjoyable or challenging. A poorly designed level can make a game feel frustrating and tedious, so it is important to put a lot of the development time into finding the player's experience that you, as a developer, want to make.</p>
<p>But, there isn't a general rule that can be followed just to make a game's level design perfect. There are some factors, like the game's difficulty or the game's genre that heavily influences the level design</p>

## Different types of game level design
<p>For example, this is just a few</p>

 * Shooter Level Design
<p>Shooter-level design generally focuses on providing the player with intense action sequences and challenges. There are some Mobile Game Development Services that also focus on this genre.</p>

 * Puzzle Level Design
<p>Puzzle level design is a process of creating levels for a game that focuses on providing the player with puzzles to solve. The goal of puzzle-level design is to create challenging but not impossible levels and to provide the player with a sense of satisfaction upon completing them.</p>

<p>As you can see, every genre have a different approach of game level design. If the levels are well designed, players will more likely enjoy the game and keep returning for more.</p>
